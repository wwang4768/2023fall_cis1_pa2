Please kindly find the file listing below, as well as more information on program structure in the report. 

File Listing:

calibration_library.py:  the script that all relevant frame transformation, set registration and pivot calibration methods reside  
dataParsing_library.py: the script that read in input data and parses it into consumable format for the algorithm in calibration_library.py to further process  
homework_1,py: the driver code for programming assignment 1, which read in input data, performs calibration and output the result to a txt file in the same folder  
validation_test.py: the script that contains a series of unittest that examines the basic functionality of implementation in calibration_library.py and dataParsing_library.py 
pa1-unknown-h-output.txt:  the output file which contains expected Ci, pivot G and pivot H generated by the calibration script for unknown dataset h
pa1-unknown-i-output.txt:  the output file which contains expected Ci, pivot G and pivot H generated by the calibration script for unknown dataset i
pa1-unknown-j-output.txt:  the output file which contains expected Ci, pivot G and pivot H generated by the calibration script for unknown dataset j
pa1-unknown-k-output.txt:  the output file which contains expected Ci, pivot G and pivot H generated by the calibration script for unknown dataset k    
pa_student_data: the extracted folder which containx relevant input debug and unknown data provided
