Computer Integrated Surgery 1 - Programming Assignment 2 By Zechen Xv (zxu139), Esther Wang (wwang177)

Please kindly find the file listing below, as well as more information on program structure in the report.

PROGRAMS Folder File Listing:
calibration_library.py: the script that all relevant frame transformation, set registration and pivot calibration methods reside

dataParsing_library.py: the script that read in input data and parses it into consumable format for the algorithm in calibration_library.py to further process

distortion_library.py: the script 

homework_1.py: the driver code for programming assignment 1, which read in input data from source files stored under "PA1 Student Data", performs calibration and output the result to a txt file in the OUTPUT folder

homework_2.py: the driver code for programming assignment 2, which read in input data from source files stored under "PA2 Student Data", performs model fitting and distortion correction, then output the result to a txt file in the OUTPUT folder

validation_test.py: the script that contains a series of unittest that examines the basic functionality of implementation in 

calibration_library.py and dataParsing_library.py 

pa1-unknown-h-output.txt: the output file which contains expected Ci, pivot G and pivot H generated by the calibration script for unknown dataset h 

pa1-unknown-i-output.txt: the output file which contains expected Ci, pivot G and pivot H generated by the calibration script for unknown dataset i pa1-unknown-j-output.txt: the output file which contains expected Ci, pivot G and pivot H generated by the calibration script for unknown dataset j pa1-unknown-k-output.txt: the output file which contains expected Ci, pivot G and pivot H generated by the calibration script for unknown dataset k

pa_student_data: the extracted folder which containx relevant input debug and unknown data provided
